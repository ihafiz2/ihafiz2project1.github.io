    <h1>Understanding the influence of biochemical markers and lifestyle choices on Heart Disease</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our detailed analysis of the influence of different common factors on heart disease through interactive visualization. 
    This series dives into various aspects of cardiovascular health, focusing on key elements that affect heart disease risk and prevalence. 
    Our goal is to provide a thorough analysis that not only informs but also empowers you with a deeper understanding of how factors like 
    age, gender, and lifestyle impact heart health. By exploring these dimensions, we aim to equip you with valuable insights and help you 
    make informed decisions regarding your health.</p>

        <h3>Scene 1: Cardiovascular Disease: Gender Population - Age, Physical Activity, Alcohol Intake & Smoking Habits</h3>
        <p>We begin our exploration by analyzing how the propensity of heart disease depends on age and how physical activity, alcohol intake, and 
        smoking habits influence this trajectory. This scene uncovers the risk of heart disease with age and habits of smoking and alcohol intake
        and the crucial role of physical activity in mitigating these risks. By understanding these patterns, we can develop effective prevention 
        strategies and tailor health recommendations to different stages of life. Our analysis based on cardiovascular dataset found on Kaggle.
        The data consists of 70,000 patient records, 34,979 presenting with cardiovascular disease while 35,021 without. There are 11 features
        4 of them demographic, such as age, height, weight and gender, 4 of them biochemical markers, such as Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure
        data, Cholesterol and Glucose levels and 3 of them are physical habits, such as physical activity, smoking and alochol intake.</p>

        <h3>Scene 2: Cardiovascular Disease: Gender Poulation - Obesity Level</h3>
        <p>In this scene, we examine the impact of obesity levels on the propensity of heart disease across genders. By comparing the prevalence 
        of heart disease between men and women, we highlight the effect of obesity specific to genders and its correlation between healthy 
        individuals and patients with heart disease. This analysis underscores the critical role of obesity in heart disease risk and offers insights
        into potential prevention strategies.</p>

        <h3>Scene 3: Cardiovascular Disease: Gender Population - Glucose & Cholesterol Levels</h3>
        <p>In this scene, we investigate the effects of glucose and cholesterol levels on heart disease risk, focusing on gender differences.
         We provide a detailed analysis of how these key health indicators influence heart health and highlight the importance of monitoring 
         these levels as part of a comprehensive health strategy. Learn how managing glucose and cholesterol can play a pivotal role in 
         reducing heart disease risk.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>This narrative visualization transcends mere statistics, offering a story of how various factors contribute to heart disease risk and how
     we can address them. We invite you to engage with these scenes, explore the data, and gain a deeper understanding of heart disease and its 
     management. Together, letâ€™s take proactive steps toward improving heart health.</p>
